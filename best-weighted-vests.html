Whether you’re looking to enhance your workouts or keep your muscles strong, a weighted vest can do the trick. I use a weighted vest for some of my cardio routine to simultaneously add a bit of strength training to the mix and I find it helpful and convenient. That said, I’ve scoured the internet for weighted vests and came up with a comprehensive list of different types based on price, fit, weight, and style. Plus, I spoke with physical therapists about the benefits of using weighted vests and how they can take your fitness routine to the next level.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-best-weighted-vests>Our top picks for best weighted vests</h2><h3>Best budget weighted vest: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Henkelion Weighted Weight Vest</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best budget weighted vest</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Henkelion Weighted Vest Weight Vest for Men Women Kids Weights Included, Body Weight Vests Adjustable for Running, Training Workout, Jogging, Walking</h3></p><p>For those not interested in spending $100+ on a weighted vest, this budget-friendly option from Henkelion is the way to go.

In addition to checking the manufacturer’s specific care instructions, in general, you want to remove the weights after using the vest, wipe it down, and let it air dry.&nbsp;</p><p>If it smells, you can hand wash it with soap and water and let it air dry to keep it in pristine condition.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-weighted-vests>How we selected the best weighted vests&nbsp;</h2><p>To find the best weighted vests, I researched different brands on the market and analyzed several based on user experience, professional expertise, and customer reviews. My list includes different weighted vests well suited for a range of fitness levels, activities, and price points.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-weighted-vest>What to consider when buying a weighted vest</h2><h3>Adjustability&nbsp;</h3><p>Finding an adjustable weighted vest is essential to ensure comfort. “It’s helpful if the vest has adjustable points to optimize the fit to your body, since you want to be snug while it's being worn,” says <a rel=nofollow href=#>Leada Malek</a>, PT, DPT, SCS, board certified sports physical therapist. Some weighted vests have adjustable shoulder straps and a waistband to ensure the right fit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Price&nbsp;</h3><p>Weighted vests can vary in price depending on the weight and brand. The standard price range for weighted vests rests between $50 to $200. For example, a vest that weighs 60 pounds will generally cost more than one that weighs between 10 and 12 pounds.&nbsp;</p><h3>Weight&nbsp;</h3><p>Depending on your fitness goals, it’s important to figure out what weight will work best for your body. According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sandra Gail Frayna</a>, physical therapist and founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hudson Premier Physical Therapy & Sports</a>, you don’t want the vest to be heavier than 10% of your body weight. It’s better to start lighter and work your way up as you get stronger.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)&nbsp;</h2><h3>What type of weighted vest is best?&nbsp;</h3><p>The best type of weight vest are the adjustable ones. “A single vest that allows you to add or remove small weights will allow you to progress over time without needing to buy multiple pieces of equipment,” says Dr. Chow.&nbsp;</p><p>Other important elements to consider in a weighted vest include breathability, style, and straps according to Dr. Malek.</p><h3>Are weighted vests good for training?&nbsp;</h3><p>Yes, weighted vests are good for training. According to Frayna, weighted vests allow you to get a better workout, strengthen different muscle groups, enhance resistance, improve cardiovascular endurance, and improve bone health. They can be beneficial to someone looking to add resistance and strength training to their cardio routine.</p><h3>How heavy of a weighted vest should I get?</h3><p>The weight you should get depends on your fitness goals. “You can start as light as six to 10 pounds, which may be sufficient, or you can go up to 40 to 50 pounds,” says Dr. Malek. If you’re just starting out, start lighter and allow yourself time to get accustomed to it.</p><h3>What is the best weight for a weighted vest?</h3><p>A good rule of thumb is to avoid having the weights in your vest be heavier than 10% of your body weight. This will vary from person to person, but start lighter and work your way up over time.&nbsp;</p><h3>Can a weighted vest hurt your back?</h3><p>It’s unlikely, but possible for a weighted vest to hurt your back. “If someone does too much too soon with a weighted vest, there is a chance someone can get back pain,” says Dr. Chow. “However, this is not special to a weighted vest, it’s true for any sort of loading to the body. The key is starting and building gradually.”</p><h3>What muscles do weighted vests work?</h3><p>Weighted vests work the lower body and core muscles, “mostly, the muscles responsible for postural stability and propulsion like the glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, and core muscles around the trunk and spine,” says Dr. Malek. “The muscles in the shoulders and arms, while mostly unloaded, are still helping to keep the body stable with movement as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lp5q2qLTTnptmrpWowbR7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./by-the-numbers-10-memorable-movie-accountants.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="By The Numbers: 10 Memorable Movie Accountants">&larr;
