Look for a cover that’s manufactured with quality materials, and try to choose a brand name with a strong reputation for producing quality products. Consider whether the cover is backed by a manufacturer’s warranty, as well as for how long that warranty is good.</p><h3>Function</h3><p>Ryan Horton, co-founder of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Truck Brigade</a>, explains that how the tonneau cover functions is a key quality to consider. “Tonneau covers function in different ways,” he says. “Some feature a hard folding design where three panels fold up toward the cab. Other options include tonneau covers that roll up toward the cab, and there are also tonneau covers that feature a retractable design.”</p><p>When deciding which style and type of function will be best for your needs, think about how you’ll be using the tonneau cover. Consider whether any of these designs might limit or enhance the ways that you’re able to use your truck. You may also have a personal preference about the style and function that you most prefer.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>Horton notes tonneau covers come in aluminum, fiberglass-reinforced polymer, marine grade vinyl, and more. “Aluminum and fiberglass reinforced polymers will hold up better in different environments that experience snow and hail,” he says. “Marine grade vinyl tonneau covers are more suited for more moderate climates.”</p><h3>Weather protection</h3><p>Consider how well the cover protects your cargo from the elements. Look for features like weatherproof seals, a durable, a water-resistant or waterproof cover material, and secure closures that prevent drips.</p><h3>Ease of installation</h3><p>Most tonneau covers will come with instructions and are designed so you can install them yourself, but the installation process can vary. Take the time to review the installation process for each tonneau cover that you’re considering.</p><p>Think about whether the cover includes all of the necessary installation hardware, whether the installation requires any special tools, and how many people the manufacturer recommends you have present to help with the installation. You may also want to think about whether the tonneau cover can be easily removed from your truck if you need to haul a large object that won’t fit under the cover.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Think about the level of security you need. Soft tonneau covers can be opened relatively easily, so they’re not necessarily the best choice if you want a cover that’s going to help to protect your cargo. If strong security is important, you may want to opt for a hard tonneau cover with a lock that can physically prevent anyone from being able to open the cover or your truck tailgate.</p><h3>Accessories</h3><p>Think about whether accessories are important to how you plan to use the cover. For example, covers are available with storage straps and systems, locks, and more. You can also buy organization systems, truck bed mats, and even truck bed light kits to enhance your use of the tonneau cover.</p><h3>Fit</h3><p>Finally, take the time to verify that the tonneau cover you’re considering will fit your pickup truck. Tonneau covers typically fit certain make and model trucks that fall within a rate of manufacture years. Have your vehicle’s make, model, year of manufacture, and bed length handy as you shop to confirm the cover will fit.</p><h2 id=types-of-truck-bed-tonneau-covers>Types of truck bed tonneau covers</h2><p>Tonneau covers are divided into two main categories: soft covers and hard covers. Within those categories, you’ll find covers that operate in different ways. Some covers lift straight up, while others can be folded or rolled. Some covers are hinged while others are retractable. These different types of covers offer different pros and cons, and each style will impact the space in your truck bed and the installation process, too.</p><h2 id=hard-vs-soft-truck-bed-tonneau-cover>Hard vs soft truck bed tonneau cover</h2><p>John Lin, owner of <a href=# rel=nofollow>JB Motor Works</a>, encourages shoppers to consider the level of protection they need and their budget when deciding between a hard and soft tonneau cover. “Hard covers offer more security and durability, but are generally more expensive than soft ones,” he explains. “Soft covers, on the other hand, are lighter, easy to remove, and economical.”</p><p>Horton notes it’s also important to understand how you plan to use your truck and what you will be hauling in the bed. Different tonneau covers can be better suited to haul large items, and other covers can be better suited for more volatile climates,” he says. “Tonneau covers have different weight ratings, so if storing something on top of the tonneau cover is an option, it is important to be aware of the weight ratings on the top tonneau cover.”</p><h2 id=how-to-install-tonneau-covers>How to install tonneau covers</h2><p>Horton explains that the installation process varies depending on the tonneau cover model and application, but most covers are installed by clamping the cover to the bed rails. “I recommend laying out all parts and cleaning your bed rails adequately prior to installing the tonneau cover,” he says. “This will ensure there are no areas where water might leak through into the bed.”</p><p>Lin explains that installation is usually straightforward, and most covers come with a manual that’s easy to follow. “However, if you’re unsure, don’t hesitate to go to a professional, as wrong installation could not just damage the cover, but your truck bed as well,” says Lin.</p><h2 id=how-i-picked-the-best-tonneau-covers>How I picked the best tonneau covers</h2><p>As someone who owns a pickup and has experience with purchasing several tonneau covers, I was excited to take a deeper dive into this topic. In choosing the best tonneau covers, I considered factors such as the cover’s overall design, the material, and its durability. I looked at how the tonneau cover performs over time, as well as how versatile it is and how well it may work for different drivers. I also weighed factors like how complicated the installation process is, as well as the cover’s overall aesthetics.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do tonneau covers improve gas mileage?</h3><p>A <a href=# rel=nofollow>2007 study</a> by the Specialty Equipment Market Association found that tonneau covers improved the coefficient of drag for pickup trucks in a wind tunnel. Two fiberglass tonneau covers and two roll-up vinyl covers had the best performance, improving the coefficient of draft by 6.5% or more. By reducing drag, the tonneau covers likely help to improve a pickup truck’s fuel economy.</p><p>On average, the covers in the study reduced the coefficient of drag by 5.73%. The study notes such an improvement could amount to a 1.8% improvement in gas mileage.</p><h3>How does a tonneau cover form a seal with my truck?</h3><p>Tonneau covers form a seal by connecting with your bed rails. Because of this, it’s important to clean your bed rails before installing the cover, and to make sure that you install the cover properly and tightly. Many tonneau covers include a gasket seal that you can add to your bed rails to create a secure seal.</p><p>If you want to further waterproof your tonneau cover, you may want to purchase an extra gasket seal to place over the top of your tailgate where it meets the tonneau cover. This area often has a looser seal and can develop leaks.</p><h3>Do tonneau covers deter theft?</h3><p>Tonneau covers help keep your belongings out of sight, and they require thieves to perform the extra step of opening the cover or opening your tailgate. Keep in mind that soft covers can generally be easily rolled or folded up, so if you want to maximize your truck’s security, consider buying a hard cover that locks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lpKS7r7HArmScp6aav3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chantal-jouanno-annonce-le-lancement-dun-plan-daction-national-pour-la-restauration-des-cours-deau.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chantal Jouanno annonce le lancement d'un plan d'action national pour la restauration des cours d'ea">&larr;
