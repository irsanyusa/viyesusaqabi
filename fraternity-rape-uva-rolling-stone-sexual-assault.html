Off-campus frat parties weren’t quite how I pictured spending my weekends at a new school – I wasn’t actually part of the Greek system – but it became clear quickly that they were the center of the social structure. They controlled the alcohol on campus, and thus, the social life. So there I was, week after week, joining the throngs of half-naked women trekking to fraternity row.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We learned the rules to frat life quickly, or at least we thought we did. Never let your drink out of your sight. Don’t go upstairs – where the bedrooms were housed – without a girlfriend who could check in on you later. If one of us was denied entry to a party because we weren’t deemed “hot” enough – houses often ranked women on a scale of one to 10, with only “sixes” and up granted entry to a party – we stuck together. Maybe we went to the foam party next door.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In two years at the University of Southern California, I heard plenty of stories of women being drugged at frat parties. At least one woman I knew was date raped, though she didn’t report it. But most of us basically shrugged our shoulders: This was just how it worked… right?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If the <a href=# rel=noopener>recent headlines</a> are any indication, it certainly appears so. Among them: women blacked out and hospitalized after a frat party at the University of Wisconsin, only to <a href=# rel=noopener>discover</a> red or black X’s marked on their hands. An email guide to getting girls in bed called <a href=# rel=noopener>“Luring your rapebait</a>.” A <a href=# rel=noopener>banner</a> displayed at a Texas Tech party reading “No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal” – which happened to be the same slogan chanted by frat brothers at Yale, later <a href=# rel=noopener>part of</a> a civil rights complaint against the university.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And now, the story of Jackie, who alleged in a <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone article</a> — swiftly becoming the subject <a href=# rel=noopener>over fairness in reporting</a> whether the author was negligent in not reaching out to the alleged rapists — that she was gang raped by seven members of the Phi Kappa Psi house at the University of Virginia, and discouraged from pressing charges to protect the university’s reputation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The alleged rape, it turned out, took place at the same house where another rape had occurred some thirty years prior, ultimately landing the perpetrator in jail.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m sick about this,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Caitlin Flanagan, a writer and UVA alumna </a>who spent a year documenting the culture of fraternity life for a recent <a href=# rel=noopener>cover story in the Atlantic</a>. “It’s been 30 years of education programs by the frats, initiatives to change culture, management policies, and we’re still here.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Which begs the question: Why isn’t every campus in America dissolving its fraternity program — or at least instituting major, serious reform?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not every fraternity member is a rapist (nor is every fraternity misogynist). But fraternity members <a href=# rel=noopener>are three times more likely to rape</a>, according to a 2007 study, which notes that fraternity culture reinforces “within-group attitudes” that perpetuate sexual coercion. Taken together, frats and other traditionally male-dominated social clubs (ahem: <a href=# rel=noopener>the Princeton eating club</a>) crystalize the elements of our culture that reinforce inequality, both gender and otherwise.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For starters, they are insulated from outside perspective. It wasn’t until the late 1960s that Greek organizations eradicated <a href=# rel=noopener>whites-only membership clauses</a>; as a recent controversy at the University of Alabama <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a>, only one black student had been permitted into that Greek system since 1964. Throughout the country, the fraternities grew into “caste system based on socioeconomic status as perceived by students,” John Chandler, the former president of Middlebury, which has banned frats on campus, recently told <a href=# rel=noopener>Newsweek</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And when it comes to campus social life, they exert huge social control: providing the alcohol, hosting the parties, policing who may enter–based on whatever criteria they choose. Because sororities are <a href=# rel=noopener>prohibited from serving alcohol</a>, they can’t host their own parties; they must also abide by strict <a href=#>decorum rules</a>. So night after night, women line up, in tube tops and high heels, vying for entrance. Even their clothes are a signifier of where the power lies. “Those with less power almost invariably dress up for those who have more,” Michael Kimmel, a sociologist at Stony Brook University, wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>in a recent column</a> for TIME. “So, by day, in class, women and men dress pretty much the same … At parties, though, the guys will still be dressed that way, while the women will be sporting party dresses, high heels and make up.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And when frat boys grow up? They slide right into the boys club of the business world, where brothers land Wall Street jobs via the “fraternity pipeline,” as a recent <a href=# rel=noopener>Bloomberg Businessweek piece put it</a> — a place where secret handshakes mean special treatment in an already male-dominated field. Fraternities have <a href=# rel=noopener>graduated</a> plenty of brilliant Silicon Valley founders: the creators of Facebook, Instagram, among others. They’ve also brought us Justin Mateen, the founder of Tinder, who stepped down amid a <a href=# rel=noopener>sexual harassment lawsuit</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Evan Spiegel, </a>the Snapchat CEO, whose recently apologized for e-mails sent while in the Stanford frat where Snapchat was founded, which discussed convincing sorority women to perform sex acts and drunkenly peeing on a woman in bed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(<a href=# rel=noopener>VIDEO: My Rapist Is Still on Campus: A Columbia Undergrad Tells Her Story</a>)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If we lived in a gender-equal world, fraternities might work. But in an age where 1 in five college women are raped or assaulted on campus, where dozens of universities are under federal investigations for their handling of it, and where the business world remains dominated by men, doesn’t the continued existence of fraternities normalize a kind of white, male-dominated culture that already pervades our society? There is something insidious about a group of men who deny women entry, control the No. 1 asset on campus – alcohol – and make the rules in isolated groups. “[Colleges] should be cultivating the kind of sensibility that makes you a better citizen of a diverse and distressingly fractious society,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Frank Bruni wrote it in a New York Times</a><i> </i>column this week. “How is that served by retreating into an exclusionary clique of people just like you?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The argument for Greek life – at least for the mainstream, largely white frats that seem to be the problem – goes something like this: It’s about fostering camaraderie. (According to a 2014 <a href=#>Gallup Poll</a>, fraternity and sorority members have stronger relationships with friends and family than other college graduates.) It’s about community: As the <a href=# rel=noopener>Washington Post</a> reported, chapters at UVA reportedly raised $400,000 for charity and logged 56,000 hours of community service during the past academic year. It’s part of a student’s free right to congregate. And also about training future leaders. According to Gallup, fraternity and sorority members will end up better off financially, and more likely to start businesses than other college graduates.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the real benefit – at least the unspoken one – may be about money. Frats breed generous donors: as Flanagan pointed out in her Atlantic piece, fraternities save universities millions of dollars in student housing. At least one study has confirmed that fraternity brothers also tend to be generous to their alma maters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All of which is part of the problem. Who wants to crack down on frats if it’s going to profoundly disturb campus life?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">UVA, for its part, has suspended the frat in question until the new year, what the Inter-Fraternity Council <a href=# rel=noopener>described</a> as a helpful opportunity for UVA’s Greek system to “take a breath.” The university’s president has said that the school “is too good a place to allow this evil to reside.” But critics saw the punishment as a slap on the wrist: a suspension, when most students are out of town for the holidays?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are other options on the table: The school is <a href=# rel=noopener>reportedly considering</a> proposals to crack down on underage drinking and even a ban on alcohol. Other universities have explored making fraternities co-ed. And there’s some evidence that fraternity brothers who participate in a <a href=# rel=noopener>rape prevention program</a> at the start of the academic year are less likely to commit a sexually coercive act than a control group of men who also joined fraternities.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet all the while, the parade of ugly news continues. A group of frat brothers at San Diego State University <a href=# rel=noopener>interrupted</a> a “Take Back the Night” march last week by screaming obscenities, throwing eggs and <a href=# rel=noopener>waving dildos</a> at marchers. The next night, a woman reported she was sexually assaulted at a party near the school’s campus; she was the seventh person to come forward this semester. And on Monday, Wesleyan announced that its Psi Upsilon fraternity would be banned from hosting social events until the end of 2015, also because of rape accusations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fraternities have created something that’s fairly unique in the modern world: a place where young men spend three or four years living with other men whom they have vetted as like them and able to “fit in.” What do you expect to happen at a club where women are viewed as outsiders, or commodities, or worse, as prey, and where men make the rules? It should be no surprise they end up recreating the boys club — and one that isn’t all so great for the boys, either.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Jessica Bennett is a contributing columnist at </i><a href=#><i>Time.com</i></a><i> covering the intersection of gender, sexuality, business and pop culture.
