The cuisine received an average popularity score of 84% across the 24 nations we studied.</p><p>Patriotically, the biggest fans of Italian food are Italians themselves, with 99% enjoying their national cuisine. Other big fans include Spaniards (94% of those who have tried it say they like it) and the French (92%), while the least impressed by Italian food are the Chinese (59%).</p><p><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>Second place behind Italian food goes to Chinese cuisine, which scored on average 78% across the countries surveyed. It’s liked by 95% of Chinese people, with Singaporeans (94% of those who say they've tried it) and Hong Kongers (91%) also particular fans. The cuisine is least popular in Saudi Arabia (54%) and Indonesia (57%).</p><p>The world’s third most popular cuisine is Japanese, scoring an average of 71% across the 24 nations. Aside from the 94% of Japanese people who like it, 94% of Singaporeans who have tried it also do, as well as 93% of Hong Kongers. Once again it’s the Saudi Arabians who are least enamoured, with only 43% enjoying it.</p><p>At the bottom of the table comes Peruvian cuisine, which received an average score of only 32%. Scoring only fractionally higher (and rounding to the same percentage score) was Finnish cuisine.</p><p>It should be pointed out, however, that Finland was one of the countries surveyed but Peru was not, meaning that the loyal 94% of Finns who like their own country’s cuisine was enough to give them the edge. Had the study included Peruvian opinions then Finnish cuisine would likely have come bottom.</p><p>The lowest opinion any nation had for another nation’s cuisine was Japan towards Saudi Arabian cuisine, with just 11% of Japanese people who have tried it saying that they like it.</p><p>In fact, the survey finds that Japanese people are the harshest food critics of any nation surveyed. Of the 34 cuisines we asked about, 23 scored less than 50% among Japanese respondents. On average only 39% of Japanese people who had tried any given foreign food said that they liked it.</p><p>By contrast, it’s Filipinos who are the most likely to appreciate international cuisine. An average of 67% of Filipinos who had tried any given cuisine said they liked it, with only five types of food being liked by fewer than half.</p><h4><strong>British cuisine is looked down on in Europe, but is more popular further afield</strong></h4><p>British cuisine is regarded as unpalatable across mainland Europe. While 91% of Britons say we like our own national cuisine, fewer than half of those in the other European countries agreed.</p><p>Holding our national dishes in particular disdain were the Germans, Spaniards, Danes and French, of whom only 25% to 28% who had tried our food said they liked it.</p><p>Only the Japanese hold our cuisine in greater contempt - just 20% like it.</p><p>Nevertheless, British cuisine tended to be more warmly received elsewhere outside of Europe, with a majority of people saying they like it in 11 of the 15 non-European countries surveyed. It’s particularly popular in Singapore (76% of those who have tried it say they like it) and Australia (71%).</p><p>When it comes to what Britons themselves like, we put Italian food on a level-pegging with our own national dishes, with 91% who have tried either cuisine saying they like it. This is followed by Chinese food (86%) and then Indian (84%).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmeDdH6MoquapJmWu26v1KKqoqaVYsSwvsudqmaln6jBbrzOqaylmaI%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kim-kardashian-butt-paper-magazine-covers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian's Paper Magazine Butt Cover: Her Best Photos">&larr;
