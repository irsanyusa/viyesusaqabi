Raised by a single mother who worked 12-hour days, the young Katorah Marrero became a precocious wordsmith and the first girl ever to join her school’s football team. In 2009, her older brother was murdered by a fellow gang member, sending her into a deep depression. Fast forward to seven years later, she was on top of the hip-hop world when her song “Ooouuu” <a href=#>broke out as a defining single</a> of 2016, making her a rising star and one of the few successful openly gay women in hip-hop history.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But while <a href=# rel=noopener>“Ooouuu”</a> brought her fame and wealth, the Brooklyn rapper suffered a deluge of problems behind the scenes, including addiction, depression and interpersonal issues with her inexperienced team as they struggled to handle the withering spotlight. “The expectation leaves you in a confused position,” Young M.A tells TIME. “I really didn’t know what to do, because all of this is just coming so forceful towards me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her narrative has all the makings of a film biopic—but at the moment, Young M.A is content to tell the story herself. Her debut album, <i>Herstory in the Making</i>, arrives Sept. 27; it’s a startlingly raw and detailed autobiography that explores her hardscrabble upbringing, mental health battles, relationship struggles, homophobia and the perils of fame. Producers including Zaytoven and Mike Zombie provide bruising launchpads for her crisp and complex cadences, which reinforce her prowess as a formidable rap classicist.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s been a long three years since “Ooouuu,” and Young M.A understands that the attention span for popular artists has never been shorter. But the rapper was insistent on taking her time, staying independent as opposed to signing with a label and creating a body of work that would transcend a viral moment: “I was really looking more in terms of longevity,” she said. “I’m definitely someone that believes in the classic vibe of a full-length album with so many different sounds.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an interview with TIME, Young M.A opened up about her past and delved into the most revealing lyrics on <i>Herstory in the Making</i>. Excerpts from that conversation are below.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>TIME: “Ooouuu” was a huge hit in 2016. Have you been crafting this album the whole time since then?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Young M.A.: </strong>I’ve been learning since then. I didn’t want to just jump because I had a wave. I know the routine thinking when it comes to the industry: when you’re buzzing, you drop the album. The pressure is on. Everything was just changing for me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So I almost fell back into a corner. Artistically, I’m not creative when I’m in that state of mind. Some people were like, “Man, this is it!” But I’ll second-guess it sometimes. And that’s a gift and a curse for me and that’s what prolonged things as well: having so much integrity and not just giving anybody anything because that’s what people are asking for. Had I released it before, I wouldn’t have been happy with that work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>How did your life change after the song’s success? On the new album, you rap that you “had to break up with fame because it broke my mood apart.”</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m such a sucker for hip-hop in general, and fame was something I dreamed about since I was a kid: Everybody knowing my name, performing in front of thousands of people.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But I didn’t know about the dark side of fame. Your privacy is taken away. Certain people in your circle, your family, change: they see you in a different way. It’s not just, “This is my cousin”; It’s, “This is the superstar in the family.” It’s a depressing feeling sometimes to just be acknowledged one way—that it’s just all about Young M.A now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fame changes a lot of things around you. Your circle and your family become smaller. You maneuver different because you’re not too sure of anything, of the people around you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>You also rap about your struggles with drinking: “I was losing focus / Stuck on that evil potion.”</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometimes in the studio it loosens the flow, the tension. It has you feeling more outspoken.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But it was smooth on the surface. Inside, it was broken. Dealing with life, fame, family, my brother not being here. And then getting caught up in the lifestyle. You’re in these clubs, people handing you bottles every time you turn around.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I couldn’t go nowhere without a bottle of Hennessy. It became a little addicting—a habit of drinking no matter where I went. I still battle that, even now. It’s something that kind of runs in my family as well. Sometimes I look at it as an escape, from all the pressure and BS that I deal with. I wanted to speak on it on the album because I know I’m not the only person that has that type of battle with any drug or addiction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>You’ve recently announced that you are not using a label in regards to your sexual orientation. On the album’s first song, you rap, </strong><b>“F-cking with the same sex, some say it’s a sin / But I’m a dyke and she a femme, it’s a synonym.” What were you trying to convey with that line?</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of course, it’s spitting bars. It’s having fun, too, and letting them know, the terms they use—it don’t affect me, it don’t affect us.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m not a label person. Before, I used to think being a label was cool. With this industry, they didn’t welcome a person like me, what I represent. I busted some doors down, with no hesitation. But then I got to a point where it was just like, “I don’t need nobody defining me. Sometimes I don’t even know my damn self.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No disrespect to anybody that prefers that. The LGBT community, I love them with my soul. But I’m me. We know who we are, we know what we represent, we know who we love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Do you still face discrimination for being a gay rapper?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That’s everywhere. It ain’t just the rap community—it’s all around the world. We all struggle with some type of problems with race and identity. That’s just the world we live in. Of course, we’re trying to change it. And I’m thankful that the majority of the people are starting to accept it. But you’ll still have people who have these strong beliefs—and sometimes you just can’t change their minds. I don’t live my life worrying about how everybody else is living because I’ll lose my mind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>How do you feel the rap industry has changed since you entered it?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I feel like the talent and the craft and the love of music is starting to slowly be smothered under all the extra stuff: gossip and social media and clout chasing. Seeing how the industry is transforming into less about music and more so about just controversy—it discouraged me a little bit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I don’t believe in being this rapper gimmick thing. Nine times out of ten, their fanbase’s majority is just bandwagoners, people that just see that, but when it’s time to really show the real you, are they still going to be rocking?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m me all day. And that’s why I have such a loyal fanbase because they get that from me—they feel like I’m part of their family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>You dedicated “No Love” to your brother, who was murdered a decade ago. Does it get any easier to write about him?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s never easy. My brother not being here is something I carry with me every day. It’s definitely an escape for me to be able to express that verbally on a track. You do have your moments where you still kind of be in denial. When I have to rap about it, it kind of puts me back into reality. All you can do is, instead of being angry inside, let it out.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even to this day, still, you never heal. My mom, she’s still going through it, every day, probably even worse. I try my best to be there for her. Sometimes I get frustrated with her because I feel like, “Come on! Let’s get it together, it’s been so long now.” She goes to therapy but I don’t. I’m just trying to stay busy. That’s all you can do.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>You call yourself bipolar on the album. Have you been diagnosed?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m very moody and I know that: I can be laughing with you one minute, and the next minute I ain’t saying nothing. But it’s not something I really believe I suffer from, because I don’t believe in no doctor telling me that I’m something. You can’t officially determine that: we all deal with depression and anxiety. That’s something I deal with too. But I’m not gonna let anybody tell me I’m bipolar: I’ll tell myself I’m bipolar.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Since “Ooouuu” came out, New York rappers have been blowing up one after the other, from Cardi B to A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie to <a href=# rel=noopener>Pop Smoke</a> to <a href=# rel=noopener>Lil Tecca</a>. Do you feel like you helped start the movement to bring the New York sound back to the mainstream?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of course. Everybody knows I came to the gate talking all my Brooklyn sh-t. And still I’m still on that vibe. And of course I’m going to take credit for that because that’s something I initiated. Because I love New York rap and I grew up when it was on fire—with Hov [Jay-Z], 50 Cent, Dipset, DMX, Ja Rule. I love my city.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>There’s also been a new generation of female rappers achieving success, from Lizzo to Tierra Whack to Megan thee Stallion to Rico Nasty. Do you credit yourself for their rise?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shoutout to the people that be like, “I don’t even consider M.A a female rapper. She’s just a dope artist overall.” I don’t do the label thing. Shoutout to <a href=#>all the female rappers</a>—I got nothing but love for them—but that’s not my competition. To be cocky, that’s not who I’m trying to go against. I’m trying to compete with these dudes, too: I’m at these dudes’ necks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>You’ve recently made headlines in connection with two other stars: Kodak Black, <a href=# rel=noopener>who referenced you in a song using a homophobic slur</a>, and Kehlani, who <a href=# rel=noopener>you name-dropped on “Big.”</a> Have you heard from either of them?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I never got a chance to see Kodak or speak to him. I know it became a big thing, but I’m off that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Kehlani</a>—that’s my people. We text every now and then have been talking about doing music together. I told her that definitely now they hear me shout you out, working together is mandatory. She’s an official dope girl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubmhpfXiDjrKmrqaXYrqieceeqaysn6fGbrXNrZyrrpmaxHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-celebrity-couples-who-kill-the-stigma-that-tall-women-cant-date-short-guys-796518.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Celebrity Couples Who Kill the Stigma That Tall Women Cant Date Short Guys">&larr;
