I’d been shown a world where there were no boundaries, where everyone gave me all the power. And I was like, ‘This is great!’ Then that was gone. But I still want that.’ I’d lost my humble, very quiet, introverted sensibilities which I think I had as a kid.</li><li>You just have to surround yourself with people who are going to support and love you before trying to sell you as a product or push you into something you don’t want to do.</li><li>My characters are often without a parental figure.</li><li>You don’t miss what you never had.</li><li>Everyone is slowly catching on to this one – and I know everyone says this – but we need to make a little more effort with the environment. Everyone says they turn off their lights, but do they?</li><li>I hate the stereotype of the pitfalls of the child actor. There are so many amazing examples – Natalie Portman, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore – of people who have made it through.</li><li>I don’t think many people can say they’ve been the lead in a Spielberg film and still been able to live the healthy life that they had before.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f544c00e4e13fb96.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating details about Michael Sheen</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Jamie Bell is a celebrated English dancer and actor.
